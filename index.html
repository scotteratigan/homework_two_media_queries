			<p>An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.</p>
			<p>Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.</p>
			<p>You’re disgusting. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.</p>
			<p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.</p>
			<p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.</p>
